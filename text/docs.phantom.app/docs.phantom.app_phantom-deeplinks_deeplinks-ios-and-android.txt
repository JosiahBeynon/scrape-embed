We refer to both of these workflows collectively as "deeplinks".Currently only Solana is supported for deeplinks.All Provider Methods follow a protocol format of:https://phantom.app/ul/<version>/<method>It is also possible (but not recommended) to call these methods using Phantom's custom protocol handler:phantom://<version>/<method>In addition to these provider methods, Phantom also supports Other Methods that are accessible via deeplinks. Specifically, users can open web apps within Phantom's in-app browser via the Browse deeplink.PreviousError Messages & CodesNext - Phantom DeeplinksProvider MethodsLast modified 2mo agoCopy link
